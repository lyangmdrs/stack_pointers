***
The goal of this exercise is to get 1 KB of ***STACK*** memory space and separate it in two spaces, each one with 512 B. The first space will be pointed by ***MSP*** and the second will be pointed by ***PSP***.

As such, when the processor is on ***Handler Mode***, the first portion will be used as stack memory.

By consequence, when the processor is on ***Thread Mode***, the second portion will be used as stack memory.
